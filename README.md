Liberating imprisoned data (PDF tables) from NYC MTA.
![mta 2019-11-23 13_15_00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4397663/69483758-54444700-0df9-11ea-9a7a-263bd2a8495c.gif)



## Why
MTA's 2020-2024 $51.5 billion capital investment + $3.3 billion for MTA Bridges and Tunnels over the next five years is 70% larger than the 2015-2019 Program, addressing core system priorities that will deliver major benefits to New York's transit infrastructure.
"The maintenance and continual improvement of the transit system relies on the MTA Capital Program, a series of five-year investment plans which began in 1982." Over the past 37 years, $128 billion has been invested in the system. 

Yet, the data behind the allocation of this money is locked away in PDF document rendering it useless to more advanced analysis and interogation by the public at large.

## What
[A csv file](https://github.com/argo-marketplace/mta-data-liberation/blob/master/MTA%20capital%20plan%20%282020-2024%29%20-%20MASTER.csv) containing the allocations of ~$49 Billion of capital spending has been created for more advanced analysis and interogation by the public at large.

## How
A paid license of Adobe Acrobat was used to convert the tables containing project / program listings from the [original PDF document](https://new.mta.info/document/10511) into an Excel spreadsheet, which was then cleaned manually by Varun Adibhatla.
